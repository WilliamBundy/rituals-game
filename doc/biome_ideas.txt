Biome Ideas:

Tundra: coldest biome, no trees
	- Alpine tundras occur at high elevations, are well drained
		- Thin grasses, rocky
		- Some big mammals
		- No permafrost
	- Arctic tundra
		- Permafrost: gravel + fine particles, very cold
		- Lichens
		- Ponds and bogs form from melting snow
		- More smaller mammals, but things like polar bears, wolves, arctic foxes

Taiga: boreal forest
	- Better soil, more water than tundra
	- Might be slightly warmer
	- Mostly cold-tolerant evergreens

Deciduous Forest
	- Fertile soil, varied temparature, even precipitation
	- Lots of light gets through, so significant underbrush

Swamp
	- Cooler than jungle
	- High high rainfall
	- Large pools of water

Tropical forest: jungle
	- little temperature variance
	- little precipitation variance (high)
	- soil is nutrient-poor and acidic?
	-
