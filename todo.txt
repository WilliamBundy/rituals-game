Rituals 2018 Projects:
	- The big cleanup
		- Code-wise, this is basically as "done" as it can get. We've cleaned out
		the unneccessary cruft, but in order to keep the game "functioning" (it's 
		really kinda broken right now) not much else can be removed without 
		fundamentally changing the internal data flow: separating the definitions
		of things into data, then loading them separately.
		- For this to make sense, we need to _have_ stuff in the game that can be
		cleanly separated. Make lists of contents to be separate
	- C++ to C conversion: line by line
	- World generation "tweaks"
		- World-gen: 3 parts. Logical-world, screen layout, individual screen
		- Logical world: what screens are important? How do we connect biomes?
		What resources are available? What dungeons are placed? What rituals are 
		possible?
		- Screen layout: How do we connect different areas together in order for
		them to create interesting spaces? 
		- Individual screen: how do we apply the high-level goals for the generation
		in low-level level design contexts?
	- Fix Simulation
